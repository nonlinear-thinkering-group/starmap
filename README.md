Starmap
=======

the starmap (as opposed to a projectroadmap) lays out the project's area's of research and how they connect nonlinearly.

__nonlinear__: A nonlinear system is a system in which the change of the output is not proportional to the change of the input.

__thinkering__: A portmanteau of "thinking" and "tinkering". Means to think about something by tinkering with *objects* relating to the problem under consideration. Usually unguided and exploratory, often a very good way to explore aspects of difficult problems or to find solutions where none are obvious. In other words, an active form of thinking.

## Structure

The project research can be `devided` into different fields which all interlink:

#### Computational engine
The way data and models are stored, and computations are done.

#### Thinking / Pedagogy
The way in which people think, how they learn, and how those to interact to learn new ways of thinking.

#### Tinkering
"Thinking on your feet". We learn not by merely thinking, but by articulation. 

#### Ecological HCI

#### Diagrammatic reasoning
Reasoning by means of visual representations. The study of diagrammatic reasoning is about the understanding of concepts and ideas, visualized with the use of diagrams and imagery instead of by linguistic or algebraic means.

#### Hypertext
Structure of nonlinear narrative

#### Languageing
The reciprocal, meaning-making activity by which adjacent organisms first create, then settle on, a workable code of communication.

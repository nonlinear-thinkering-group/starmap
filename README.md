Starmap
=======

the starmap (as opposed to a projectroadmap) lays out the project's area's of research and how they connect nonlinearly.

__nonlinear__: A nonlinear system is a system in which the change of the output is not proportional to the change of the input.

__thinkering__: A portmanteau of "thinking" and "tinkering". Means to think about something by tinkering with *objects* relating to the problem under consideration. Usually unguided and exploratory, often a very good way to explore aspects of difficult problems or to find solutions where none are obvious. In other words, an active form of thinking.
